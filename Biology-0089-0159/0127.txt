C3 Plants :
C3 Plants are called as 
C3 because it produce the product 
of three carbon compound called 
phosphoglycerat durin C3 Cycle .
C3 # Cycle :-
During this the CO2 
is fixed by rubisco ( enzyme ) with
RUBP to from 3PGA , Here the 
another enzyme called phosphoglycerate 
kinase use ATP molecule and 
from ATP # the pi is added with 
3PGA to form 1,3PGA and another 
# enzyme phosphoglycerate 
dehydrogenase # # which 
# reduce # . NADPH to NADH 
and Pi is released Here so 2 molecules 
of 3 Phosphoglyceral dehyle is formed . # in 
# # 6 molecule , # 5 molecules recycled 
and #  # regenerate RUBP
