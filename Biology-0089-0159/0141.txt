Chromatography :-
Chromatography is a mean
of separating one type of molecule
from others it # involves moving
the mixture , normally as a gas , over 
a stationary phase embedded in
cellulose or silica . The separation
may depend on a range of chemical
and physical properties of the
molecules such as solubility and
molecules mass . Essentially there are
two basic ways of carrying out the
seqaration .
