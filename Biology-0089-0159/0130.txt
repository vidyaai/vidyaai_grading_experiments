Photophosphorylation : 
In the process 
of photosynthesis , the #
phosphorylation of ADP to form
ATP using the energy of sunlight 
is called photophosphorylation . 
All organisms produce ATP , which is 
the universal energy currency 
of life .
Only two sources of energy are 
available to # living organism :
Sunlight and reduction-oxidation 
( redox ) reactions .
