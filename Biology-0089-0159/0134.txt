Topic Cytoplasm :-
-> The living contents of eukaryotic cells are divided into 
nucleus and Cytoplasm , the #together forming the
protoplasm . Cytoplasm is aqueous ( water Containing ) substance 
Containing a veriety of cell organelles and other
structures Such as insoluble wastes and storage products .
The soluble Part of the cytoplasm forms the ground
Substance between the cell organelles and is Called cytosol .
It is formed of about 90% water and forms a
solution which Contains all the fundamental biochemicals
of life . In sytosol , small molecules and ions may forms
true solutions , and some large molecules from collodidal 
solutions . A Colloidal solution may be sol ( non viscous )
or a gel ( jelly like or viscous ) . Often the outer region 
of cytoplasm is more gel like .
-> Apart from acting , as storage of vital chemicals ,
the ground substance ( Cytosol ) is the site of certain
metabolic Pathways , such as glycolysis ( In living Cells
the cytoplasm Contain servel Cell organelles such as ;
