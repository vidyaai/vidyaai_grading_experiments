Photorespiration :-
Phot - Light
Respiration - consumption of O2
Production of CO2
Diffination :-
The # reaction of RuBisco
with O2 # & metabolic Processing
result in #  Phosphoglycerate .
# is called # Photorespiration 
# because of it only occurs 
in light . This # # occur ,
# in three # organll#ien .
1) Chloroplast 
2) Mitochondrio
3) Peroxisom
# # #
4) Chloroplast :- The first step# - is
oxidation :- in which RiBisco react 
with O2 form 2PG and 3PGA .
