=> Photorespiration :,
The reaction of RUBISCO
With oxygen and metabolic processing of
the resulting 2-PG is called 
photorespiration . It is called this because 
It only occurs in the light 
# respiration in darkness 
because it consumes oxygen &
produces , just like #
=> # This process occurs in 
three organelles i.e. #
# & mitochondria .
=> There are some common 
environmental conditions that promote 
Rubisco to reach as # such
as elevated internal temperatures
( 32C ) or low CO2 concentrations insides
photosynthetic cell in relation to higher
levels of O2 accumulated .
