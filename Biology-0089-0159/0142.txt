Tissue Culture :-
Tissue culture is the growth of tissue
and cells separate from the organism . 
This is typically facilitated by the use of 
liquid semi-solid growth medium such as 
broth , or agar . Tissue culture produce clones
in which all the product cells have the same 
genotypes unless affected by mutation during
culture . In the following section a list of
apparatus and main steps of tissue culture
are given .
