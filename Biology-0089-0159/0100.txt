The universally accepted model about the 
plasma membrane is Fluid-mosaic-Model 
Musaic of lipid & protein .
This model was proposed by Singer and
Nichdson in # 1972 . 
Plasma membrane is a lipid bilayer in 
which protein arranged in varing degree .
Types of protein :
Intrinsic protein :-
Also known as integral protein .
Present both across the lipid bilayer .
Extrinsic protein :-
Also know as # external protein .
Present on the outer surface of membrane .
Fluidity of Memembrane :
Membrane is more and more fluid 
not rigid or solid due to changing 
position of # protein &
lipid , The membrane include carbobohydrat
