Function Of Golgi Apparatus :-
Golgi aaparatus helps in the # 
storage of secretory products and # 
in the modification and packaging of
secretory products . In some cases
polysaccharides #may be synthesized 
from simple # sugars in the Golgi
apparatus . These polysaccharides may
them be attached to proteins lipids
to form glycoproteins and glycolipids . 
Secretory vesicles produced by the 
#Golgi apparatus may play an
important role in adding surface 
area to the plasma membrane .
