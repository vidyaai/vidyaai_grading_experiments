Therefore, the behavior of the codes barely changes except when with a large buffer, the pointer would move forward in the buffer array. When changing all three values of products to produce, buffer size and sleep string, the num_full value varies in different settings. (NF for num_full or is placed in bracket, l for items, m for size for simplicity.) The first item produced is immediately consumed. That is, initially the buffer is empty (0), then an item is produced (1), then consumed right away (0). Therefore, when only 1 item is produced and consumed, producer puts EOS into the buffer (1), which after the consumer takes it, would terminate the process (0). When l<=m, after the (0-1-0) sequence, the consumer would put to sleep for a second. Assuming the producer could produce infinite products before the consumer wakes, NF would reach l because of l-1 items + EOS, which EOS is also regarded as an item in this setup. After the consumer wakes, it would consume an item every second, until EOS is reached, or NF = 0. When l>m, after the (0-1-0) sequence, the producer would flood the buffer (NF=m) until the consumer consumes an item. And right after an item is consumed (m-1), the producer would put the new item into the buffer, or EOS if it is the end of production (m). Finally, as the producer stopped producing, the products inside the buffer would be consumed in 1 item/s, until EOS is reached, or NF = 0.",

Start with a buffer (size 1), and then increase it. How does the behavior of the code change with larger buffers? (or does it?) What would you predict num_full to be with different buffer sizes (e.g., -m 10) and different numbers of produced items (e.g., -l 100), when you change the consumer sleep string from default (no sleep) to -C 0,0,0,0,0,0,1?",
            "answer": "If the buffer is size 1, the user_ prt and the fill_ prt always point at the same address. The larger buffer code has different buffer for producer and consumer. The consumer sleep string make the producer have the chance to fill every slot for each buffer. For buffer size of 10 the num_full will become 10 or 9 for the most time because the consuming speed less than the speed of producing.",
            "sample_answer": "With larger buffers, producer can add multiple values to the buffer (up to the length of the buffer) before it waits or context switches, and vice versa for the consumer. The second question models consumers that take much longer to consume items than it takes for producers to produce items. The consumer grabs one item each and then immediately falls asleep for one second, leaving the producer to fill the buffer. The producer would then sleep until the consumer woke up and cycle repeated. (Help to understand the second question model) The buffer would thus spend most of its time full, i.e. num_full would always be equal to or close to the buffer size. Since there is only one empty buffer slot, the producer will run once, and until the loops are over for each, they will take turns to add/remove one at a time.",
