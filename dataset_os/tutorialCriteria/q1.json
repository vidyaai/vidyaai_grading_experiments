        "answer": "The response time and turnaround time for three jobs using the FIFO policy and SJF policy are the same in the given order of job length. If we change the order of job length, response time and turnaround time for the SJF policy should remain the same.\nHowever, the results for FIFO policy in different orders will change. In particular, if we run these jobs in order 300, 200, 100, it makes FIFO perform poorly (the average response time is 266.67, and turnaround time is 466.67).",
